These nutrients are critical for every cell function and hence, prevent the aging process and help us look youthful.</li><li>Cardiovascular disease: Greens are low in fat, high in dietary fiber, and rich in folic acid, potassium, magnesium, vitamin C, and phytochemicals. One extra serving per day can lower the risk of cardiovascular disease by 11%.</li><li>Type 2 diabetes: The high level of magnesium and low glycemic index that can be found in greens is ideal for preventing and treating diabetes. Studies showed that if you increase your intake of greens by just one serving per day, your risk of diabetes is lowered by 9%.</li><li>Bone health: The high levels of vitamin K, Magnesium, and calcium in leafy greens produces osteocalcin, the bone builders. Middle-aged women who eat over one serving of greens per day will lower their risk of a hip fracture by 45%.</li><li>Immune function: The rich beta-carotene and Vitamin A improve the immune system.</li><li>Protect eyes: Children who consume inadequate amounts of Vitamin A have a higher risk of going blind.
