<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Junk foods are dishes that are loaded with excess calories but have little to no nutritional value. Usually, these foods are high in saturated and trans fats. Consistent consumption of these foods increases the intake of unhealthy fats and refined carbohydrates, which potentially raises the risk of chronic medical issues. By eating junk foods constantly, you might also end up getting habituated to them. As a result, you may not be too keen to consume healthy foods, such as vegetables, fruits, and mixed greens, among others, resulting in a lack of nourishment.&nbsp;</p>
